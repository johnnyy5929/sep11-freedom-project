## Content 
This is my blog 4. So as you may know we have this project called the Freedom Project which is our year-long project. We picked a tool that we wanted to use and made a game out of it or whatever we wanted. So what I decided to pick was kaboom js. I have been using this tool by using [kaboom website](https://kaboomjs.com/) in this website you are allowed to see the codes you can use and you can go to the playground which has games and codes for those games. Another thing I used was the [learning log](../tool/learning-log.md) Here you can see all the LL I have done. So we had a break and we did some stuff but most of what I have done is for my LL.

## My LL 7-9







### Future and MVP

## Engineering Design Process
The Engineering Design process is the part of the project you are on. So I am currently on the fifth Engineering Design process which is created, so the problem we are fixing is that people are too scared to cook. So maybe they would want to cook online, what we are doing is making a game where people can cook, make their own way of cooking, serving customers, and having fun with friends. So far we have made a prototype where my teammate has made the levels and I have made it so you can talk to people. This is our prototype so far, we need to make improvements and add more things to do in the game. therefore the step we are on is the create step which is making a prototype of the game which we made a part of the game so far. 

## Skills 

## Researching
One of the most important parts is the research. I had to do a lot of searches to find what I was looking for. There were many codes that I had to find, so I had to research hard and long until I found the right codes. After that, I also had to find pictures that I could use for the code and find ways to use the code. This is why research is important: You find stuff that you really need. 

## Communication 
Communication is really important as you during the break I needed to talk with my teammate since we needed to get work done. I had to talk to them when I needed help and when they wanted help. This got us through a lot as when we didn't understand something we just asked each other. Also when we were working together I had to ask what the code was looking at and what we should do and not do. During the break, we couldn't talk in school as there was no school. So communication is one of the most important skills that we should all know and it would be helpful in the future since later on you have to talk with others.
