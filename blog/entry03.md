So as you may know we have this project called the freedom project which is our year long project. We pick a tool that we wanted to use and make a game out of it. So what I decided to pick was kaboom js. I been using this tool by using [kaboom website](https://kaboomjs.com/) in this website you are allowed to see the codes you can use and you can go to the playground which has games and codes for those games. Another thing I used was the [learning log](../tool/learning-log.md) Here you can see all the processes I have done.
