So we have a year long project called the freedom project. In this project I have to choose a couple of tools. However I decided to go with kaboom. kaboom is a website where you can make games and learn about different codes for these games. Some of which I been learning from LL's. Last time we only did LL1 and LL2. Now we did 3 more, the way I been coding is using [kaboom website](https://kaboomjs.com/) in this website you are allow to see the codes you can used and you can go to the playground which as games and codes for those games. Another thing I used was the [learning log](../tool/learning-log.md) In here you can see all the process I have done. As some of the codes I learned are.
