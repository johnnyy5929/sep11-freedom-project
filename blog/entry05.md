## Content 
This is my blog 5. Throughout this school year, we had a project called the Freedom Project. This is our year-long project where we had to pick a tool and learn how it use it. We are getting to our final parts of the project. We have coded an MVP up to this point, which is like a start to our project. So I finished my MVP during the break for this cooking game I was doing. I made some changes to the initial project. So the tool that I picked was Kaboom JS, and in some ways, I learned this was by using [kaboom website](https://kaboomjs.com/). On this website, you are allowed to see the codes you can use, and you can go to the playground, which has games and codes for those games. Another thing I used was the [learning log](../tool/learning-log.md) where I put all the information I learned into. So wondering what I did for the freedom project. 




## Engineering Design Process


## Skills 

## Researching
Researching is a really important part, I had to research how to use Kaboom and find pictures. Sometimes when I am trying to find a picture, I can't, so I have to improve my research and type in more to find what I am looking for. This was important because I was trying to find a part of Kaboom, and I didn't know I couldn't just search for Kaboom and find what I was looking for. I needed to search Kaboom mousepress or something like that to find the code I was looking for. So I learned that this is important.

## Communication 
Another thing I learned is how important communication is. When you are working with a teammate, you need to communicate because if you don't, it is hard to know what your partner is thinking and what you should be doing. During this, I ask what my partner is doing, and we both learn different things, so we can finish faster. Also, communication is useful when you need help, like when I have trouble learning something, I can ask people for help. This is important because if Google can't help me, maybe someone else can. So communication is really important, not and can it be helpful in the future. You should always communicate. Communication is really important and is a skill that we should use and do for everything. It is helpful and easy to finish when you talk to someone.
