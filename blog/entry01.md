So we have a year long project called the freedomproject. In this project I have to choose a couple of tools. The first tool I picked was kaboom, and my backup tool is next.js. So what is so intersting about kaboom, kaboom is a place where you can make 2D games. This got me really intersted, it reminds me of the old games I used to play. My backup was next.js where you can make website better. this got me interested, I could make a website for a game. However by the end I decicied to use kaboom. So with kaboom I am planning on making a game with Katherine. The game we will make is a cooking game so people who are afriad of cooking in real life can get a understanding online. So wondering how I beem tinkering well, you can see in my [learning log](../tool/learning-log.md) that I been tinkering by looking at code and trying them out.

## Sources 
Wondering about the sources I used, well the sources I used for next.js is

## Skills 
### Commutation
When I was doing my work, I asked around for people's help, I didn't know that much hardware and software so I asked people. Also when I didn't know what the problem was I asked people what they thought the problem was. It is hard to come up with a way to solve the problem so I asked around as well. So commutation is a good skill to learn and will help me in the future because I know how to communicate easier than before.


### How to find what you are looking for
When I was googling, I saw so many results. It was hard to look for what I wanted to look for, however I away around it, I found that when you are trying to find something you should be more specific with it, what I mean is type in all the thinks you are looking for, this is a good skill that I learned that will help me later when I am googling or researching.
