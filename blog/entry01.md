### Commutation
When I was doing my work, I asked around for people's help, I didn't know that much hardware and software so I asked people. Also when I didn't know what the problem was I asked people what they thought the problem was. It is hard to come up with a way to solve the problem so I asked around as well. So commutation is a good skill to learn and will help me in the future because I know how to communicate easier than before.


### How to find what you are looking for
When I was googling, I saw so many results. It was hard to look for what I wanted to look for, however I away around it, I found that when you are trying to find something you should be more specific with it, what I mean is type in all the thinks you are looking for, this is a good skill that I learned that will help me later when I am googling or researching.
