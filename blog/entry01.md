## Content 
So we have a year long project called the freedom project. In this project I have to choose a couple of tools. The first tool I picked was kaboom, and my backup tool is next.js. So what is so interesting about kaboom, kaboom is a place where you can make 2D games. This got me really interested, it reminds me of the old games I used to play. My backup was next.js where you can make websites better. this got me interested, I could make a website for a game. However, by the end I decided to use kaboom. So with kaboom I am planning on making a game with Katherine. The game we will make is a cooking game so people who are afraid of cooking in real life can get an understanding online. So wondering how I've been tinkering, you can see in my [learning log](../tool/learning-log.md) that I've been tinkering by looking at code and trying them out. Like for LL1 I learned how to move and how to push things. I put it all together for a "game". 

## Sources 
Wondering about the sources I used, well the sources I used for next.js is the [next js website](https://nextjs.org/) which on this website you get to see what next.js does and a cool thing is that the website has feature of next.js in it. Another source I used was [youtube](https://nextjs.org/) it went over what next.js is and how to use it. As I said before I decided on kaboom so the sources for kaboom I used was the [kaboom website](https://kaboomjs.com/) in this website you are allow to see the codes you can used and you can go to the playground which as games and codes for those games. Another thing I used was the [learning log](../tool/learning-log.md) . In this I put everything I learned and will be helpful for the future. These were the sources I used.

## Engineering Design Process
Engineering Design process is the part of the project you are on. So I am currently on the third Engineering Design process which is Brainstorming, I define the problem and research the problem. Now I need to find a way to make the product, so I am planning on making a game with Kaboom. I learned a lot from my learning log. I made a design of the game in my mind. I just need to find a way to put this game into real life. I would also say I am on the plan part of EDP because I have a idea of what to do but I just need to create it and see if this would be the best way around making the game. If it isn't I was planning on designing it differently.
## Skills 
### Commutation
When I was doing my work, I asked around for people's help, I didn't know that much about kaboom so I asked people. Also when I didn't know what the problem was when I was doing some code. So I asked people like Joe what they thought the problem was. Also I help people remember to do their learning log. So commuting is a good skill to learn and will help me in the future since it can help me and people around me.

### How to find what you are looking for
When I was googling, I saw so many results. It was hard to look for what I wanted to look for, however I away around it, I found that when you are trying to find something you should be more specific with it, what I mean is type in all the thinks you are looking for, this is a good skill that I learned that will help me later when I am googling or researching.
