## Content 
So we have a year long project called the freedomproject. In this project I have to choose a couple of tools. The first tool I picked was kaboom, and my backup tool is next.js. So what is so intersting about kaboom, kaboom is a place where you can make 2D games. This got me really intersted, it reminds me of the old games I used to play. My backup was next.js where you can make website better. this got me interested, I could make a website for a game. However by the end I decicied to use kaboom. So with kaboom I am planning on making a game with Katherine. The game we will make is a cooking game so people who are afriad of cooking in real life can get a understanding online. So wondering how I been tinkering well, you can see in my [learning log](../tool/learning-log.md) that I been tinkering by looking at code and trying them out. Like for LL1 I learned how to move and how to push thing I put it all together for a "game". 

## Sources 
Wondering about the sources I used, well the sources I used for next.js is the [nextjs website](https://nextjs.org/) which on this website you get to see what next.js does and a cool thing is that the website has feature of next.js in it. Another source I used was [youtube](https://nextjs.org/) it went over what next.js is and how to use it. As I said before I decidied on kaboom so the sources for kaboom I used was the [kaboom website](https://kaboomjs.com/) in this website you are allow to see the codes you can used and you can go to the playground which as games and codes for thoses games. Another thing I used was the [learning log](../tool/learning-log.md) in this I put everything I learned and will be helpful for the future. These were the sources I used.

## Skills 
### Commutation
When I was doing my work, I asked around for people's help, I didn't know that much about kaboom so I asked people. Also when I didn't know what the problem was when I was doing some code. So I asked people like Joe what they thought the problem was. Also I help people remember to do there learning log. So commutation is a good skill to learn and will help me in the future since it can help me and people around me.

### How to find what you are looking for
When I was googling, I saw so many results. It was hard to look for what I wanted to look for, however I away around it, I found that when you are trying to find something you should be more specific with it, what I mean is type in all the thinks you are looking for, this is a good skill that I learned that will help me later when I am googling or researching.
