## Content 
This is my blog 6. Throughout this school year, we had a project called the Freedom Project. This is our year-long project where we had to pick a tool and learn how it use it. We are getting to our final parts of the project. We have coded an MVP up to this point, which is like a start to our project. So I finished my MVP during the break for this cooking game I was doing. I made some changes to the initial project. So the tool that I picked was Kaboom JS, and in some ways, I learned this was by using [kaboom website] (https://kaboomjs.com/). On this website, you are allowed to see the codes you can use, and you can go to the playground, which has games and codes for those games. Another thing I used was the [learning log](../tool/learning-log.md) where I put all the information I learned into. So wondering what I did for the freedom project.
